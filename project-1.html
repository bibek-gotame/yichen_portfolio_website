                                circle) before committing to watch a series. We created <b>My Watchlists</b> as a

                        <p>The issue we face with Netflix is about how people feel about things. Because a company is
                            trying to provide a service and be loved, it is especially vital to consider this version of
                            personification — this is much more analogous to a humanized relationship than it is with
                            your car, where Netflix can actually be a partner. Since loyalty is sought, this is a great
                            framework for our research because we evaluating if Netflix is a responsible partner in

                        <p>Based on our research, we saw similarities with the idea of a human relationship. This

                        <p>This hierarchy mirrors the theory proposed by psychologist <b>Abraham Maslow</b> . Maslow
                            argues that there are FIVE stages of human needs that motivate behaviour. Our goal was to
                            visualize and understand the types of relationships that people form with Netflix. Similar
                            to <b>ups and downs</b> of relationship, we organized each level of the pyramid is organized
                            in terms of <b>strengths and weakness, </b> which take into account how members and

                                    Netflix falls short in representing a <b>genuine brand that is trustworthy when I’m

                                    Netflix <b> isn’t personalized enough</b>

                                    Churning can be avoided by <b>investing in personal relationships.</b>
                                    Currently, adding to My List from home (via +) <b>carries little meaning;</b> the
                                    show is simply added to a large grid of titles
                                    Creating collections within My Lists conveys a curated tone that allows for greater
                                    control & understanding of what each title means to the respective user.
                                    By curating their extensive library into watch lists, Netflix has the opportunity to
                                    <b>show members they value their time and support.</b>

                        <p>As a freshman residing on the east coast in an entirely remote year, I was extremely anxious
                            to tackle a 4-month long project, and my first design project at that.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, working with Netflix taught me how to leverage effective storytelling to empathize
                            with users and understand their pain points. After conducting extensive qualitative and
                            quantitative research and gathering insights in order to learn from members who consistently
                            leave the service and come back, I gained a strong grasp on how to evaluate the impacts of
                            users' pain points on specific company actions & decisions. We worked closely with a senior
                            UX designer who taught us how to use these insights to inform and validate actionable
                            product strategies. Researching brand loyalty and user relationships to create a meaningful
                            narrative was likewise a rewarding experience and we were enlightened by the significance of
                            parasocial bonds in streaming entertainment platforms.
